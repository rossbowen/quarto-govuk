## Paragraphs

The default [paragraph](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/paragraphs/) font size is 19px.

### Bold

This is **bold** text and this is ***bold italics*** text.

### Italics

This is *italicised* text.

### Strikeout

This is ~~struck-through~~ text.

### Inline code

This is an example of `inline code` within a paragraph.

### Inline mathematics

This is an example of inline mathematics: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ within a paragraph.

## Headings

Use [heading](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/headings/) tags, such as `##`, `###`, and so on, for headings within the document body. If a title is provided, it’s displayed as a top-level heading (`#`), so the main content should begin at level 2 (`##`) or below.

HTML supports only `h1` to `h6`. Any level beyond that is displayed in body text.

Write all headings in [sentence case](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z#capitalisation).

### Example

```md
### This is a level 3 header

#### This is a level 4 header

##### This is a level 5 header

###### This is a level 6 header

####### This is a level 7 heading
```

### This is a level 3 header

#### This is a level 4 header

##### This is a level 5 header

###### This is a level 6 header

####### This is a level 7 heading

---

## Blockquotes

Use the [inset text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/) component to differentiate a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information about the page

### Example

```md
> Block quotes can span multiple paragraphs.
>
> Block quotes can be nested.
>
> > In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution
> > $p(\theta \mid y) = \frac{p(y \mid \theta), p(\theta)}{p(y)}$
> > expresses updated belief about parameters $\theta$ after observing data $y$.
```

> Block quotes can span multiple paragraphs.
>
> Block quotes can be nested.
>
> > In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution
> > $p(\theta \mid y) = \frac{p(y \mid \theta), p(\theta)}{p(y)}$
> > expresses updated belief about parameters $\theta$ after observing data $y$.

## Lists

Use [lists](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/lists/) to make blocks of text easier to read, and to break information into manageable chunks.

### Bulleted lists

Introduce bulleted lists with a lead-in line ending in a colon. Start each item with a lowercase letter, and do not use a full stop at the end.

#### Simple bulleted list

```md
You can buy:

- apples
- oranges
- pears
- $\pi$
```

You can buy:

- apples
- oranges
- pears
- $\pi$

#### Nested bulleted list

```md
Bullet lists can also be nested to show hierarchy:

- first bullet item
- second bullet item
  - nested bullet item
  - another nested item
  - another nested $\pi$
- third bullet item
```

Bullet lists can also be nested to show hierarchy:

- first bullet item
- second bullet item
  - alpha $\alpha$
  - beta $\beta$
  - gamma $\gamma$
- third bullet item

#### Spaced bulleted list

If a list is hard to read because the items run across multiple lines you can add extra spacing.

```md
Examples of Bayesian–Monte Carlo methods include:

- Markov chain Monte Carlo, which constructs a sequence of dependent samples forming a chain whose stationary distribution is $p(\theta \mid y)$

- importance sampling, which estimates expectations by drawing from a simpler proposal and assigning weighted samples $w_i = \frac{p(\theta_i \mid y)}{q(\theta_i)}$

- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which simulates trajectories through parameter space governed by the potential energy $U(\theta) = -\log p(\theta \mid y)$ to explore the posterior efficiently
```

- importance sampling, which estimates expectations by drawing from a simpler proposal and assigning weighted samples $w_i = \frac{p(\theta_i \mid y)}{q(\theta_i)}$

- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which simulates trajectories through parameter space governed by the potential energy $U(\theta) = -\log p(\theta \mid y)$ to explore the posterior efficiently

### Numbered lists

Use numbered lists instead of bulleted lists when the order of the items is relevant.

You do not need to use a lead-in line for numbered lists. Items in a numbered list should end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

Numbered lists can also be nested and spaced.

```md
1. Delivery address.
1. Payment.
1. Confirmation.
1. $\pi$.
```

1. Delivery address.
1. Payment.
1. Confirmation.
1. $\pi$.

### Definition list

Use a definition list ([summary list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/)) to summarise information, for example, a user’s responses at the end of a form.

Use a summary list to show information as a list of key facts.

#### Example

```md
Name
: Sarah $\Phi$ Philips

Date of birth
: 5 January 1978

Address
: 72 Guild Street  
  London  
  SE23 6FH

Contact details
: 07700 900457  
  sarah.phillips@example.com
```

## Code block

This pattern is adapted from the GOV.UK Design System website and is not part of [`govuk-frontend`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend). Use code blocks to display sample code, commands, or other preformatted text.

```r
library(dplyr)

tibble(x = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)) |> 
  print()
```

---

## Horizontal rule

Use a horizontal rule ([section break](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/section-break/)) element to create a thematic break between sections of content.

---

## Line block


Line blocks are used to present lines of text, such as poetry or [addresses](https://components.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/govspeak/address), with preserved line breaks.

### Example

```md
| First line of address
| Second line of address
| 75 This street
| United Kingdom
| Phone: 07123456789
| $\pi$
```

| First line of address
| Second line of address
| 75 This street
| United Kingdom
| Phone: 07123456789
| $\pi$

## Images

Images can be included without captions.

### Example

```md
![](https://picsum.photos/400.jpg)
```

![](https://picsum.photos/400.jpg)

---

## Figures


[Figures](https://components.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/figure) are images with captions.

### Example

```md
![An example figure $\pi$](https://picsum.photos/400.jpg "This is hover text for the figure")
```

![An example figure $\pi$](https://picsum.photos/400.jpg "This is hover text for the figure")

---

## Tables

Use the [table](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/) component to make information easier to compare and scan for users.

### Example

```md
| Name  | Type    | Value |
| ----- | ------- | ----: |
| Alice | String  |    12 |
| Bob   | Integer |    34 |
| Eve   | Float   | $\pi$ |

Table: Example table with a caption and different column types $\pi$.
```

| Name  | Type    | Value |
| ----- | ------- | ----: |
| Alice | String  |    12 |
| Bob   | Integer |    34 |
| Eve   | Float   | $\pi$ |

Table: Example table with a caption and different column types $\pi$.

## Mathematics $\pi$

Mathematical notation can be included using inline or display maths. This is useful for technical content, equations, and scientific writing.

### Inline maths

```md
The solution to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
```

The solution to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

### Display maths

```md
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.
$$
```

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.
$$

## Footnotes

Footnotes are useful for providing additional information, references, or clarifications without cluttering the main text.

### Example

```md
Footnote reference [^note1].

[^note1]: This is a note containing **bold**, a `code` inline, and a mathematical expression: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.
```

Footnote reference[^note1].

[^note1]: This is a note containing **bold**, a `code` inline, and a mathematical expression: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

## Citations

Citations are used to reference sources in your document.

### Example

```md

## Links

[Links](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/links/) are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the full stop.

### Example

```md
[Example link $\pi$](https://example.com).
```

[Example link $\pi$](https://example.com).
